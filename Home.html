            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="paragraph" id="aboutUs">CircuitSpark Crates was founded by two high school students with a passion for making electronics fun, 
                hands-on, and accessible. Based in Kingston, Ontario, we design and manufacture educational tech kits that 
                teach real skills through real builds — from clocks to speakers to RC cars. Our goal is to spark curiosity 
                and creativity in people of all ages, whether you're just getting started or diving deeper into how things work.
                 Each kit is carefully designed to be beginner-friendly, customizable, and genuinely exciting to build. 
                 With a growing line of products and add-ons, plus the option for custom kits, we’re on a mission to make
